# [Transferable Skills Workshops] - Good Practicies for Reproducible Open Source Code

## Why this workshop?
Open-source software is more than just sharing code; it’s about fostering collaboration, transparency, and reproducibility. In research, industry, and education, the ability to write clear, reproducible code is a vital skill. By adopting good practices in open-source software development, we can ensure that our code is not only easier to read and understand but also guarantees reproducibility across different machines and environments.

This approach enhances the quality of our work and opens the door to effective collaboration, enabling others to build upon our contributions with confidence. Whether you’re a student, researcher, or developer, mastering these practices is key to creating software that stands the test of time and benefits the broader community.

## Learning objectives

* Understand the importance of good practices for reproducibility and collaboration.
* Apply dependency management techniques using tools like Poetry.
* Understand the best practices in repository organization.
* Create and integrate a LICENSE file to meet open-source requirements.
* Develop and execute unit tests to ensure code functionality and reliability.
